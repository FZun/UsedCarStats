# Used Car stats

The aim of this project is to give someone who has no idea about cars an insight
in the world of cars.

For that, the pages of online used car marketplaces are searched for data. All
the acquired data is then saved in an SQL Database. Finally, some multivariate
statistics are done with the available data.


First results indicate that the car model are most important for the car price
and mileage and/or fuel consumption are almost not relevant at all.

Data evaluation still in progress
